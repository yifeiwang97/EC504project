# EC504project
knn.cpp consists of all the code for the project.
NationalFile.txt has been compressed due to github size limit, you should first unzip the .rar file and put the 3 files(knn.cpp, makefile and NationalFile.txt) into SCC.
On SCC, (1)make -f makefile
        (2)knn NationalFile.txt
Then you can see the user interface.
Note that, when inputing a coordinate, you can ONLY INPUT SCALARs! Otherwise the program will crush.
